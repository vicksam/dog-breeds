    "I always wanted to build a model that could be used by anyone. *'Tell me what type of dog it is'* is a simple idea that could be made into an app. It would tell you the type of dog on a picture or... the one that you resemble. The main problem is to build a classifier strong enough to work not only with clean and prepared data, but with more diverse one like user made photos.\n",

    "Here I'm going to build a model for it. I will use a convolutional neural network (CNN), a network type doing really well with image recognition. First, I'm going to use pre-trained models to know if it is an image of a dog or human. Then I will use a CNN to predict the matching breed. You will see me building two CNNs, one from scratch and the other one using transfer learning. I'm curious how they will compare."
